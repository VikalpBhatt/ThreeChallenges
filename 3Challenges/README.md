Three Challenges
======================

#Challenge1
* I have used `docker-compose` to solve this problem. Have taken docker images of all three tiers namely front-end using `AngularJS`, backend as `Java Spring Boot` and Database as `MongoDB`.
Application is designed to let the user enter employee details and then shows them in a tabular form on the same screen.
  
  To run follow below steps-
  * Login to GCP platform, set the projectID.
  * Open GCP CLI and give ./Challenge1-bash.sh.
  * Bash script will install the respective dependecies.
  * Launch the external URL of the VM and you will see the homepage.

#Challenge2
* Have used `AWS CLI` to extract the metadata and output them in an json format. The same can be done for any cloud providor be it `GCP`, `Azure` as instance templates are common across.
  
  To run follow the below steps-
  * Login to AWS platform and open AWS CLI.
  * Give command as per the bash script or just run bash script.
  * Output will be shown in JSON format for you to save.

#Challenge3
* I have done this by writing a small Javascript function having a nested loop to iterate through the given nested object until the end and printing the result at the end.
  
  To run follow the below steps-
  * Execute the script in any Javascript env and the results will be displayed.
